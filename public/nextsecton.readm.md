this is your requirment--To properly implement the Invoice Preview â†’ PDF Export section, I need to understand your current setup. Please provide the following documents/code:

1. Current Invoice Preview Component

- The React component that displays the invoice preview
- How it renders the invoice data
- What styling/layout it uses

2. Invoice Data Structure

- Your complete invoice type/interface
- Sample invoice data structure
- How the data flows to the preview

3. API Route Structure

- Your current API routes (if any)
- How you're handling invoice data retrieval
- Your preferred API structure

4. Dependencies & Tech Stack

- What PDF generation library you prefer (or if you want recommendations)
- Your current dependencies in package.json
- Are you using any specific styling framework?

5. Invoice Templates

- Do you have multiple invoice templates?
- How are templates structured?
- Any specific branding/styling requirements?

6. Database Schema

- Your invoice model/schema
- How invoices are stored
- Any related models (company, client, etc.)
  PDF Generation Options I Can Implement:
  Option A: HTML to PDF (Server-side)
- Uses libraries like puppeteer or playwright
- Renders your React component as HTML then converts to PDF
- Best for complex layouts and styling
  Option B: PDF Generation Library
- Uses jsPDF or PDFKit
- Programmatic PDF creation
- Good for simple, consistent layouts
  Option C: React to PDF
- Uses @react-pdf/renderer
- Create PDF components similar to React components
- Good balance of flexibility and control
  Which approach interests you most? Or would you like me to recommend based on your current setup?
  Once you provide the current code, I can implement the complete PDF export functionality with proper error handling, loading states, and optimized performance.--here is my invoicePreviewForm--get me the react to PDF for my next js 15 projectEditPerfect! I can see your Invoice Preview component and I'll implement the React to PDF solution for your Next.js 15 project. Based on your code, I'll create a comprehensive PDF export system using @react-pdf/renderer.Invoice PDF Export ImplementationCodeÂ // First, install the required dependencies:
  // npm install @react-pdf/renderer

// 1. PDF Document Component - /components/pdf/InvoicePDF.tsx
import React from 'react';

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

1. Complete PDF Generation System

Client-side PDF generation using @react-pdf/renderer
Server-side API route for PDF generation
Custom PDF styling that matches your template system
Multiple export options (download, preview, server-side)

2. PDF Component (InvoicePDF.tsx)

Mirrors your existing invoice preview layout
Supports all your template customizations (colors, fonts, display options)
Responsive PDF layout with proper styling
Includes all invoice data (items, totals, addresses, etc.)

3. Custom Hook (useInvoicePDF.ts)

downloadPDF() - Downloads PDF directly to user's device
previewPDF() - Opens PDF in new browser tab
generatePDF() - Returns PDF blob for custom handling
Loading states and error handling

4. API Route (/api/invoice/pdf/route.ts)

Server-side PDF generation for better performance
Proper error handling and validation
Returns PDF as downloadable response

5. Enhanced Invoice Preview

Added PDF export buttons to your existing component
Loading states during PDF generation
Error handling with user feedback

ðŸš€ Installation
bashnpm install @react-pdf/renderer
ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples
Client-side PDF Generation:
typescriptconst { downloadPDF, previewPDF, isGenerating } = useInvoicePDF();

// Download PDF
await downloadPDF({
invoiceData,
selectedCompany,
selectedClient,
calculations,
template: customization,
});

// Preview PDF in new tab
await previewPDF({...});
Server-side PDF Generation:
typescript// POST to /api/invoice/pdf
const response = await fetch('/api/invoice/pdf', {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
body: JSON.stringify({
invoiceData,
selectedCompany,
selectedClient,
calculations,
template: customization,
}),
});
ðŸŽ¨ Template Support
The PDF generator fully supports your existing template system:

Colors: Primary/secondary colors from your templates
Fonts: Inter, Georgia, Arial support
Layout: Modern, Classic, Minimal templates
Display Options: All your show/hide toggles work
Customization: Real-time template changes reflect in PDF

ðŸ”§ Benefits of This Approach

Perfect Styling Match: PDF looks exactly like your preview
Template Flexibility: All your existing customizations work
Performance: Client-side generation is fast and doesn't require server resources
Fallback: Server-side API route for complex scenarios
Error Handling: Comprehensive error management
Loading States: Great UX with loading indicators

ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

Install the dependency: npm install @react-pdf/renderer
Add the PDF components to your project
Update your existing InvoicePreview component with the new buttons
Test the PDF generation with your existing invoice data

The system is designed to work seamlessly with your existing code structure and will generate professional-looking PDFs that match your invoice preview exactly!
