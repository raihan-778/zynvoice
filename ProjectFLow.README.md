   Instead of asking for entire sections, ask for single components:
   COMPONENT: InvoiceForm
   Context: Building Section 5 - have UI components ready
   Need: Just the invoice form component with validation

2. Specific Integration Requests
   INTEGRATE: Connect InvoiceForm to database
   Context: Have working form + database models
   Need: API route + form submission handling

3. Incremental Building
   ENHANCE: Add real-time preview to InvoiceForm
   Context: Basic form working, need live preview
   Current: [describe current state]
   Add: [specific feature]

üéØ Perfect Prompt Template

CONTEXT: [What's already built]
CURRENT STATUS: [Specific files/components ready]
SPECIFIC NEED: [Exactly what you want - be very specific]
CONSTRAINTS: [Any limitations or preferences]

Example:

CURRENT STATUS: Have Button, Input, Select components ready
SPECIFIC NEED: Invoice form with company info, client selector, line items
